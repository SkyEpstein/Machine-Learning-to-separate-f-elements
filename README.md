The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model that can correctly predict extractants that are good for separating F-Elements from each other. This means that it will dissolve one metal well (high Log_D, >1), while making sure to not dissolve it too well as to make it challenging to separate from the extractant, and will dissolve another metal not so well (low Log_D, <-1). By using the largest data set of extractant molecules and their Log_Ds with specific F-elements, and expanding upon it, by experimenting with adding certain extractant properties, morgan fingerprints (binary code that shows if the extractant has a certain trait or not) and vectors from chemprop (a machine learning model designed for use in computational chemistry), many different machine learning models were trained, using Apple’s Create ML, Apple’s MLX, and Pytorch. 
Each folder contains a few ML Models and the data files used to train them, as well as graphs and tables containing the results of testing.
ResultsData contains the error results from each of the ML models, as well as what parameteres were used to train them.
